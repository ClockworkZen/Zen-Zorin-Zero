# Zen-Zorin-Zero
Custom configuration file for setting up Zorin OS 17+ as a personal cloud


## What is it?

This is a goofy pet project that might develop into something later.

I don't actually play Zenless Zone Zero, but I like aliteration, so my project is named thusly:

* Zen - That's me! ClockworkZen!
* Zorin - That's what this project is designed to run on, [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/ "Zorin OS"), which is a pretty neat and approachable flavor of Linux built on Ubuntu.
* Zero- Uhhhh... Zero configuration, maybe? 

As this project develops, this may be less true, but for now I plan to make any recommended/default customizations clearly identifiable for customization purposes, and possibly an eventual deployment wizard to make things even easier for non-techies to get going.

## What does it do?

This "tool" is designed to ultra streamline and simplify the process of setting up several useful home server apps in a linux environment, specifically Zorin OS 17+

At this point in time, the script is tailor made for Zorin OS 17, requiring relatively few install pre-requisites that are covered in the install script itself.

Running the script will pull the latest version of the following software from public repos availible:

* Sonarr
* Radarr
* Lidarr
* Prowlarr
* qBittorrent
* SABnzbd
* Rustdusk-Server
* Plex Media Server
* Obsidian
* NextCloud
